by hand to the official reference implementation, but it isn’t present by
default. You can download a copy from the reference implementation
repository if you want it for completeness, but it’s not necessary for
completing the tutorial.

## Getting started
To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install
the needed gems:
```
$ bundle install --without production
```
Next, migrate the database:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```
Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is
working correctly:
```
$ rails test
```
If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a
local server:
```
$ rails server
```
